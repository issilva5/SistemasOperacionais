The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that illustrates the challenge of deadlock. There is a round table with n plates and n chopsticks arranged as illustrated in Figure 6.5. A philosopher sitting at each plate requires two chopsticks to eat. Suppose that each philosopher proceeds by grabbing the chopstick on the left, grabbing the chopstick on the right, eating, and then replacing both chopsticks. If philosophers follow this approach they can unfortunately, enter a deadlock: each philosopher can grab the chopstick on the left but then be stuck waiting for the philosopher on the right to release the chopstick she holds.
